Hello, fellow human (?) 👋 I am a **computer conjurer**, bridging the digital divide. 🧙‍♂️ Think of me as an **IT & Design** hybrid, which conveniently enough, is also my bachelor's title. A designer at heart, I initially only used computers for entertainment. 🎮 However, my specialization in **Human-Computer Interaction** made space in my chest for new design tools, such as coding and hardware. 💻 This love has run deep ever since. 

**Currently**, I'm part of the celebrated **EIT - Human Computer Interaction and Design** Master program. 🎓 Here, I'm destined to specialise in **Physical Interaction Design & Realisation** at the KTH (Stockholm) next year, all thanks to the sponsorship of our generous benefactors, the **European Union**. 🇪🇺 I am proud to be attending the **University of Twente** as my entry university, a place that has alumni like _Cees Links_ (**WiFi** innovator), _Jaap Haartsen_ (inventor of **Bluetooth**), and _Dirk-Willem van Gulik_ (a co-founder of the **Apache Software Foundation**)! Here, I'm fortifying my future ventures with knowledge on **business and technological entrepreneurship**. I strive to transform potent ideas into reality and refine them with and for people. 💼 

As technical entrepreneur, my passion lies in **easing human tech use**. But it doesn't stop there. Studying Interaction Technology at UTwente has given me a lens to identify design needs beyond computers. Ever struggled to clean a glass that’s just too narrow? Feelings like this, prompt me to develop my own **Design Language**. 🎨 Who knows? Maybe we'll meet at a design agency bearing my name one day? All glasses there will be spotless, I promise. Until then, I'll continue drawing inspiration from industry giants like **Apple**, **Braun** or **Teenage Engineering**. 🍏🔌🎧 

**Main Quest**: I'm employed by _AM Hanseatische Konzept- und Beteiligungs GmbH_, where my task involves simplifying the complexities of **employee timekeeping**. ⏰ Together, we aim to create a spin-off, offering an affordable product that enables customers to fulfill their obligations in a simple, self-managed way. 🎯 

I'm all about **design, development and making things happen**. Excited to see where this journey takes me next!
